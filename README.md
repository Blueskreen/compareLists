# compareLists
A command line utility for comparing lists in text files

## Description:

This program was originally created to assist in comparing log file entries to a list of computers. The input was generated by a couple batch files. Going forward I hopt to abstract it enough so that it can be useful in other contexts and provide support for regex patterns being used to tokenize the lists.

It reads the source files provided, sorts them in to arrays and then runs a binary search for each element in the other and writes the result out to the console. For more detailed information see the PrintHelp() method in compareLists.cs.

Please note that at this time not all switches are functional. I had to rush and hard code in some things that I would have rather done more dynamicly. In short, it's currently a mess and does not provide all the features I want it to, yet.

## Compiling / running
This program was originaly compiled using the following:

c:\windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\CSC.exe

It therefore is a prerequisite that you have .Net installed to compile and run this program. The following command can be used (assuming the above location is in your PATH system variable):

csc  /t:exe /out:compareLists.exe compareLists.cs
